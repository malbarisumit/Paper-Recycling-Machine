# Paper-Recycling-Machine
This repository contains my academic project done by me in my undergrad (mechanical) engineering

Paper is manufactured by wood fibers; thus, it is very costly process and also harmful to nature. Therefore, paper recycling is the best alternative to this problem. Printed and blank scrap paper is reprocessed to manufacture new paper. This process is eco-friendly and a small step toward saving our mother earth. In our project we made a small working model for our college use. Designing of various components, of paper recycling machine assembly, for example pulper, deinking tank, blade, rollers etc. has been carried out. It is completely an ecofriendly process and cost-efficient process due to recycling

●	Designed the paper Recycling via Pro E
●	Manufactured the machine components using lathe machine, drilling, welding
●	Used pulper to make thick shake of wastepaper
●	Used froth floatation technique via deinking pan to remove the ink from wastepaper
●	Used rollers for pressing and heated rollers for water evaporation
